# X-Team 56 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

We will discuss our strengths and weaknesses and assign tasks corresponding to our strengths. 
If time permits, we will reassign tasks if any individual is encumbered with their current workload.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

We will track each others progress through github and make sure everyone is completing tasks. We will also use groupme as our 
way of communicating with one another. Groupme is the main way for messages to get between members.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will bring up any concerns of ours to the other members in the group after giving it our own best effort. From there,
all other members of the group will assist as they can in order to ensure that the task is completed.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
